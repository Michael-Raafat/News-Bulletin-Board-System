# News Bulletin Board System

## Overview
In this system there are several processes accessing the system, either getting the news from the system or updating
the news.
The system will consist of a server that implements the actual news bulletin board and several remote clients that communicate with the server using the TCP/IP protocol suite.
The remote clients will have to communicate with the server to write their news to the bulletin
board and also to read the news from the bulletin board. After the implementation using TCP/IP, it will be modified to work using RMI.
